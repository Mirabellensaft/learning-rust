## The Structs type

**1. The struct syntax**
    a. Define a struct.
    b. Create an instance of it.
    c. Print the email address using the dot notation.
    d. Make the instance mutable.
    e. Change the email address using the dot notation, and print it.

 **2. Building a function that returns instances of a struct.**
    a. The functions parameters are the variables email and username, both are strings. It returns a user instance. The struct is defined inside the function, the fields active and sign_in_count are set to true and 1. Inside the function, the signifier 'struct' as well as type specifications are not used. The struct needs to be in the same scope as the function.

    b. Define the variables for email and username.
    c. Move them into the function, to create the instance for a second user. print the email address.

**3. Create an instance from another instance with the struct update syntax.**
    a. Create a third instance of User. Set name and password to a String.
    b. Use the dot notation to refer to the other values from user1.
    c. Print the value of active.
    d. Subsitute the values that are taken over from user1 with  ..user1
    e. Print the value of sign_in_count.
